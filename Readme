ST-DExtrap: Self-Supervised Decoupled Spatiotemporal Extrapolation for Traffic Emissions
The main contributions can be summarized in three aspects:  
1) To address the insufficiency of single-dimensional information, we design a bidirectionally dynamic-coupled joint training branch. In the forward process, it dynamically links temporal and spatial extrapolation tasks, 
where temporal extrapolation supplements spatial-temporal information using known future points while spatial extrapolation enriches temporal dimensions with unobserved spatial samples. 
Compared with temporal-then-spatial models, bidirectional dynamic correlation achieves cross-dimensional complementarity, overcomes the limitations of a single dimension, and enhances the ability to model complex dynamics.
2) For the distribution shift between observed and simulated environments, we innovatively propose an inverse mask correction strategy. During the backward process, it bidirectionally calibrates masked and original data 
to adaptively adjust invariant feature learning, effectively mitigating simulation-to-reality gaps. Compared with one-way estimation, the integration of reverse masking can improve the model's generalization ability in 
scenarios with environmental shifts.

3) A vehicle emission dataset for Chengdu is created using GPS data from over 14,000 taxis and more than 1.4 billion data points collected from August 3 to August 30, 2014. Experimental tests of the proposed method on 
this dataset demonstrate that it achieves the optimal performance in the extrapolation process with distribution shifts. Beyond extensive experimental validation, we provide strict theoretical proofs for the proposed 
framework: the joint training strategy integrates invariant representations across spatiotemporal dimensions, effectively reducing the uncertainty of extrapolation modeling.
The implementation of the three core contributions proposed in this paper is fully reflected in the provided code, with clear mapping between each contribution and the corresponding code modules. 
The detailed implementation explanation is as follows:
mplementation of the Bidirectionally Dynamic-Coupled Joint Training Branch 
The bidirectionally dynamic-coupled joint training branch, designed to address single-dimensional information insufficiency, is implemented through the  Model 3  and Model 4 
Dynamic Linkage of Temporal and Spatial Extrapolation Tasks：This forms a bidirectional dynamic link where temporal and spatial extrapolation mutually supplement each other.  
Cross-Dimensional Complementarity and Complex Dynamics Modeling：The reshaping and dimension alignment of features. Multi-task loss constraints (Loss 3–Loss 7) force the model to optimize temporal and spatial extrapolation jointly.
Implementation of the Inverse Mask Correction Strategy:The inverse mask correction strategy, proposed to mitigate the distribution shift between observed and simulated environments, is implemented through the 
mask construction logic (related to `mask_all`, `know_mask2`) and bidirectional calibration in the backward process.  
In the backward process (triggered by `total_loss.backward()`), the inverse mask correction is achieved by weighting the loss with bidirectional masks: This bidirectional calibration forces the model to adaptively adjust 
invariant feature learning—specifically, it focuses on learning features that are robust to both observed data missingness (`mask_all`) and spatial node unobservability (`know_mask2`), 
rather than overfitting to the distribution of simulated data.   
﻿The Chengdu vehicle dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance.
